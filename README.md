# Typing Test

This project is a few years old, don't pay too much attention. I just decided to publish it for fun.

## Compiling

You really want to compile this?

Fine, but sadly, compilation only works on Linux:

```sh
wget https://github.com/TudbuT/isbpl-random-stuff/raw/master/ISBPL.jar
java -jar ISBPL.jar build.isbpl build makeManifest jar
```

Add a `run` to the end of the last line if you want to execute the compiled result directly.
